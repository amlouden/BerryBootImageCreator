# BerryBootImageCreator
An easy way to create a BerryBoot image from a img file on Linux.

NOTE: This will not modify the original image file.

NOTE: Root priviliges (or sudo) are required to run this script because it needs to create a loop device and mount it

NOTE: Requires you to have kpartx and squashfs-tools installed. On Ubuntu, you can install them by typing `sudo apt-get install kpartx squashfs-tools` into a terminal.

Coming Soon.
